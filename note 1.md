# Propositional Logic
### What is propositional logic?
	identifying a statement as  true or false
- must be clearly defined and factional

### Joining Propositions together

*Propositional Forms*
- Conjunction: $P \land Q$ T = when *P* and *Q* are **true**
- Disjunction: $P \lor Q$ T = when *P* or *Q* is **true**
- Negation: $\neg P$ T = when *P* is **false**

**law of the excluded middle** 
	For any proposition *P*
